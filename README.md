## What is VividNode? 🤔

**VividNode** is a cross-platform desktop application that allows you to interact directly with LLM(GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) chatbots and generate images without needing a browser. Built with PySide6, VividNode (formerly known as pyqt-openai) supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, and securely stores your chat history locally in a database.

### Key Features:
- **Chat Interface**: Enjoy a seamless chat experience with a customizable interface, fast thread and message search, and advanced conversation settings. You can also import/export chat histories and use prompt management tools for efficient prompt engineering.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 or models from Replicate, directly within your chat sessions. The app supports multi-image generation, automatic saving, and integrated image management.
- **Focus and Accessibility Modes**: Utilize Focus Mode, “Always on Top” Mode, transparency adjustments, and background notifications to keep the chat accessible and responsive without overwhelming system resources.
- **Customization and Shortcuts**: VividNode offers extensive customization options, including language settings, memory management, and a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts for faster operations.

With VividNode, you can experience a more powerful and resource-efficient alternative to browser-based GPT interfaces, making it easier to manage both text and image-based interactions.

## Sidenote 🗒️
Although this is named 'pyqt-openai', the model does not use only OpenAI-related models, and the GUI is created using PySide6, not PyQt. 'pyqt-openai' was the package name decided initially, and we are still using it as changing the package name now would likely result in a huge disaster.
